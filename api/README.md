# Telecom API

This API is a simple API that allows you to upload a CSV file and get graphs about the data in the file. 

The implementation is in `src/telecoms` still no tests are implemented. there are `telecom.utils.ts` that are used to parse the CSV file and `telecom.mapper.ts` that is used to map the data to mongoose models.
